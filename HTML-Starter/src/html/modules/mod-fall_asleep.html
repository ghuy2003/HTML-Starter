                        Your body will tell you if you got a great nights rest, but you can remove many common discomfort problems just by 
                        switching to an Ergomotion adjustable base. With slight adjustments to your head and foot rest, you can quickly align 
                        your spine and remove the need for pillow fidgeting. Each adjustable base is fully dynamic and customizable so you can 
                        easily dial in your favorite settings to ensure you fall asleep faster and sleep deeper throughout the night.
