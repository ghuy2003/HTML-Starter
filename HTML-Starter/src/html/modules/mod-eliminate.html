                    Snoring is more common than most people think, and it often goes unnoticed. This symptom prevents people from entering 
                    deeper sleep which can contribute to more serioues health issues. * Positions like Zero-Gravity allows your nasal passages
                    to stay fully open and keeps your tongue from putting pressure on your throat. In this position, you can experience a 
                    deeper more restfull sleep.

                    *The FDA has noted that adjustable bases can aid in the treatment of a number of medical afflictions and illnesses. 
                    Normally adjusting the upper part of the bed to a higher position eliminates or reduces snoring. For some patients, 
                    snoring will prevent you from reaching a deep restful sleep, known as REM sleep.
